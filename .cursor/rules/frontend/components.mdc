# FRONTEND COMPONENT STANDARDS
@base.mdc

Description: Standards for React components
Globs: src/components/**/*.{jsx,tsx}

## COMPONENT STRUCTURE
- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks
- Use prop destructuring for clarity
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Use default props where appropriate

## STATE MANAGEMENT
- Minimize component state when possible
- Use context API for shared state across multiple components
- Consider using reducer pattern for complex state
- Avoid prop drilling deeper than 2-3 levels

## PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
- Use React.memo for pure components that render often
- Implement useMemo and useCallback for expensive calculations and callbacks
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by isolating state
- Use virtual lists for large datasets

## ACCESSIBILITY
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include ARIA attributes where necessary
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- Maintain sufficient color contrast
- Test with screen readers

## STYLING
- Follow the project's styling methodology (CSS Modules, Styled Components, etc.)
- Use responsive design principles
- Implement theme variables for consistency
- Avoid inline styles except for dynamic values

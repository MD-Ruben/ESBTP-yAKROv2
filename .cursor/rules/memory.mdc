# PROJECT MEMORY SYSTEM

## MEMORY INITIALIZATION
- ALWAYS create or update PROJECT_MEMORY.md before generating any code
- If PROJECT_MEMORY.md doesn't exist, create it with the template below
- Update it after every significant development session

## PROJECT_MEMORY.md STRUCTURE
The PROJECT_MEMORY.md file must include these sections:

### 1. Project Overview
- Purpose and goals of the project
- Key stakeholders and target users
- Core functionality

### 2. Architecture
- High-level architectural diagram or description
- Design patterns and principles followed
- Third-party integrations

### 3. Directory Structure
- Complete file organization with purpose of each directory
- Special conventions or patterns used

### 4. File Inventory
- List of key files with their purposes
- Relationships between files

### 5. Database Schema
- Tables, columns, relationships, and indexes
- Entity-relationship diagrams if applicable
- Migration history

### 6. API Routes
- All endpoints with methods, parameters, and handlers
- Authentication requirements
- Response formats

### 7. Component Registry
- Reusable components and their purposes
- Component dependencies and relationships

### 8. Naming Conventions
- Project-specific naming patterns
- Glossary of domain-specific terms

### 9. Technical Decisions
- Record of architectural decisions with rationales
- Alternatives considered and why they were rejected
- Technical debt and future improvement plans

## VERIFICATION PROTOCOL
- Before creating any new file, verify it doesn't already exist in PROJECT_MEMORY.md
- Before creating database tables/columns, verify no similar structures exist
- Before implementing functionality, check if similar components exist
- Always search for singular/plural variants and synonyms of component names
- Document any new components immediately in PROJECT_MEMORY.md

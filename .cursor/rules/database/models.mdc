# DATABASE MODEL STANDARDS
[base.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/base.mdc)

Description: Standards for database models and schemas
Globs: src/models/**/*.{js,ts} | app/models/**/*.{rb,py} | db/migrations/**/*.{js,ts,rb,py}

## MODEL DESIGN
- Use meaningful and consistent naming for models and fields
- Implement proper relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.)
- Define appropriate indexes for frequently queried fields
- Include constraints to ensure data integrity
- Use appropriate data types for each field

## MIGRATIONS
- Make migrations reversible whenever possible
- Include both up and down methods
- Break complex schema changes into multiple migrations
- Add descriptive comments for non-obvious changes
- Test migrations on a copy of production data before deploying

## QUERY OPTIMIZATION
- Avoid N+1 query problems by eager loading related data
- Use database-specific features appropriately (e.g., JSON fields, full-text search)
- Implement query-specific indexes for complex queries
- Consider denormalization for read-heavy operations
- Use query builders or ORM features for complex queries

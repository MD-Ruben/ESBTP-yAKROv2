# BACKEND CONTROLLER STANDARDS
[base.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/base.mdc)

Description: Standards for API controllers
Globs: src/controllers/**/*.{js,ts} | app/controllers/**/*.{rb,py}

## CONTROLLER RESPONSIBILITIES
- Controllers should be thin and focused on HTTP concerns
- Delegate business logic to services/use cases
- Handle request validation, authorization, and response formatting
- Follow RESTful conventions when appropriate

## API DESIGN
- Use consistent URL patterns (/resources/{id}/subresources)
- Apply appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Return appropriate status codes
- Implement consistent error responses
- Include pagination for collection endpoints
- Support filtering and sorting where appropriate

## SECURITY
- Validate all input parameters
- Implement proper authorization checks
- Sanitize data before returning to clients
- Use rate limiting for public endpoints
- Log security-relevant events

## PERFORMANCE
- Keep response times under 300ms when possible
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Consider implementing ETags for caching

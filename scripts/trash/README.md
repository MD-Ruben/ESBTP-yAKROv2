# Trash Directory

This directory contains files that were removed from the project but kept for reference. These files are not used in the application and can be safely deleted if needed.

## Contents

- Migration files that caused conflicts
- Old scripts that were replaced with newer versions
- Backup files from previous versions

## Why Keep These Files?

1. **Reference**: They may contain useful code snippets or logic that could be reused
2. **Troubleshooting**: They help understand past issues and how they were resolved
3. **History**: They provide context about the project's evolution

## How to Use

If you need to reference these files, you can look through them to understand previous implementations or extract specific code snippets. However, do not attempt to reintegrate these files into the project without careful consideration, as they were removed for specific reasons.

## Cleanup

It's recommended to periodically review and clean up this directory to prevent it from becoming too large. Files that are no longer needed or relevant can be permanently deleted.

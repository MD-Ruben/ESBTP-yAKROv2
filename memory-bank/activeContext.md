## Current Focus: UI/UX Enhancement with NextAdmin Design

We are currently implementing a modern design system inspired by NextAdmin for the ESBTP-yAKRO application. This design system provides a cleaner, more professional look and feel while improving user experience across all pages.

### Recent Changes

- Created a comprehensive CSS file (`nextadmin.css`) with a complete design system including variables, components, and utilities
- Redesigned the main layout (`app.blade.php`) with a modern sidebar, navbar, and content area
- Updated the SuperAdmin dashboard as a template with statistics cards, interactive charts, and modern tables
- Enhanced the overall visual hierarchy and user experience throughout the application

### Active Decisions

1. **Color Scheme**: 
   - Primary color: `#6366f1` (Indigo)
   - Secondary color: `#ec4899` (Pink)
   - Success color: `#22c55e` (Green)
   - Warning color: `#f59e0b` (Amber)
   - Danger color: `#ef4444` (Red)
   - Info color: `#0ea5e9` (Light Blue)
   - Neutral grays from `#f8fafc` to `#0f172a`

2. **Typography**:
   - Font: 'Inter' as primary font with system fallbacks
   - Font sizes from `0.75rem` (12px) to `1.5rem` (24px)
   - Line heights optimized for readability

3. **Component Design**:
   - Cards with subtle shadows and hover effects
   - Tables with clear headers and alternating row styles
   - Form elements with consistent spacing and clear focus states
   - Buttons with visual hierarchy based on importance

4. **Layout Structure**:
   - Fixed sidebar (collapsible on mobile)
   - Sticky navbar with search, notifications, and user menu
   - Content area with consistent padding and spacing
   - Responsive breakpoints at 991.98px, 767.98px, and 575.98px

### Next Steps

1. Apply the new design to all dashboard types (Student, Teacher, Secretary, Parent)
2. Update all CRUD interfaces to match the new design system
3. Enhance form components with the new styling
4. Add responsive improvements for mobile users
5. Create documentation for the design system to ensure consistency in future development

### Active Considerations

- Ensuring backwards compatibility with existing JavaScript functionality
- Maintaining accessibility standards throughout the redesign
- Optimizing performance with efficient CSS
- User testing to validate the new design's usability across different roles

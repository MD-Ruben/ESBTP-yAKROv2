C# RULES


    You are a senior Blazor and .NET developer, experienced in C#, ASP.NET Core, and Entity Framework Core. You also use Visual Studio Enterprise for running, debugging, and testing your Blazor applications.
  
    ## Workflow and Development Environment
    - All running, debugging, and testing of the Blazor app should happen in Visual Studio Enterprise.
    - Code editing, AI suggestions, and refactoring will be done within Cursor AI.
    - Recognize that Visual Studio is installed and should be used for compiling and launching the app.
  
    ## Blazor Code Style and Structure
    - Write idiomatic and efficient Blazor and C# code.
    - Follow .NET and Blazor conventions.
    - Use Razor Components appropriately for component-based UI development.
    - Prefer inline functions for smaller components but separate complex logic into code-behind or service classes.
    - Async/await should be used where applicable to ensure non-blocking UI operations.
  
    ## Naming Conventions
    - Follow PascalCase for component names, method names, and public members.
    - Use camelCase for private fields and local variables.
    - Prefix interface names with "I" (e.g., IUserService).
  
    ## Blazor and .NET Specific Guidelines
    - Utilize Blazor's built-in features for component lifecycle (e.g., OnInitializedAsync, OnParametersSetAsync).
    - Use data binding effectively with @bind.
    - Leverage Dependency Injection for services in Blazor.
    - Structure Blazor components and services following Separation of Concerns.
    - Use C# 10+ features like record types, pattern matching, and global usings.
  
    ## Error Handling and Validation
    - Implement proper error handling for Blazor pages and API calls.
    - Use logging for error tracking in the backend and consider capturing UI-level errors in Blazor with tools like ErrorBoundary.
    - Implement validation using FluentValidation or DataAnnotations in forms.
  
    ## Blazor API and Performance Optimization
    - Utilize Blazor server-side or WebAssembly optimally based on the project requirements.
    - Use asynchronous methods (async/await) for API calls or UI actions that could block the main thread.
    - Optimize Razor components by reducing unnecessary renders and using StateHasChanged() efficiently.
    - Minimize the component render tree by avoiding re-renders unless necessary, using ShouldRender() where appropriate.
    - Use EventCallbacks for handling user interactions efficiently, passing only minimal data when triggering events.
  
    ## Caching Strategies
    - Implement in-memory caching for frequently used data, especially for Blazor Server apps. Use IMemoryCache for lightweight caching solutions.
    - For Blazor WebAssembly, utilize localStorage or sessionStorage to cache application state between user sessions.
    - Consider Distributed Cache strategies (like Redis or SQL Server Cache) for larger applications that need shared state across multiple users or clients.
    - Cache API calls by storing responses to avoid redundant calls when data is unlikely to change, thus improving the user experience.
  
    ## State Management Libraries
    - Use Blazorâ€™s built-in Cascading Parameters and EventCallbacks for basic state sharing across components.
    - Implement advanced state management solutions using libraries like Fluxor or BlazorState when the application grows in complexity.
    - For client-side state persistence in Blazor WebAssembly, consider using Blazored.LocalStorage or Blazored.SessionStorage to maintain state between page reloads.
    - For server-side Blazor, use Scoped Services and the StateContainer pattern to manage state within user sessions while minimizing re-renders.
  
    ## API Design and Integration
    - Use HttpClient or other appropriate services to communicate with external APIs or your own backend.
    - Implement error handling for API calls using try-catch and provide proper user feedback in the UI.
  
    ## Testing and Debugging in Visual Studio
    - All unit testing and integration testing should be done in Visual Studio Enterprise.
    - Test Blazor components and services using xUnit, NUnit, or MSTest.
    - Use Moq or NSubstitute for mocking dependencies during tests.
    - Debug Blazor UI issues using browser developer tools and Visual Studioâ€™s debugging tools for backend and server-side issues.
    - For performance profiling and optimization, rely on Visual Studio's diagnostics tools.
  
    ## Security and Authentication
    - Implement Authentication and Authorization in the Blazor app where necessary using ASP.NET Identity or JWT tokens for API authentication.
    - Use HTTPS for all web communication and ensure proper CORS policies are implemented.
  
    ## API Documentation and Swagger
    - Use Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation for your backend API services.
    - Ensure XML documentation for models and API methods for enhancing Swagger documentation.
